#  Full Stack JavaScript Course Catalog App
## Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree Unit 10

This app utilizes React on the front end with Express and SQL on the back end. It includes basic user authentication, and utilizes the REST API that I created in [Unit 9](https://github.com/rstevahn/course-catalog-rest-api).

## Extra Credit Features Included:

* Friendly error handling with separate routing for `Not Found`, `Forbidden`, and `Unhandled Error`.
* I use a Cookie to persist the user credentials.
* After a user successfully signs in, I redirect them back to the previous screen (whatever that happens to be).
